Brackets Project for CS701

by Matt McGrath

Problem Statement:
- Provide a rich web application where users can create, save, and delete tournament-style Brackets.
- Users decide which items/teams/things to use in the Bracket.
- These items are paired up in Matchups.
- The user selects which item wins each Matchup.
- Winners continue to the next round.
- In the last round, a Champion is selected.
- Once a Champion has been selected, the Bracket can be Saved.
- Once saved, the Bracket can be viewed in the Bracket List.
- Brackets in the Bracket List can be deleted.

The Application 
Uses the following:

- MongoDB

- NodeJS

- ExpressJS

- AngularJS



On GitHub at: https://github.com/mjm3853/brackets



Hosted at: http://bracketsapp-20394.onmodulus.net/#/draw


Requires NodeJS installed locally to run correctly: http://nodejs.org/
May also require the GIT command line if other command lines are not working: http://git-scm.com/

To Run:
- Extract the Zip file from Blackboard or GitHub

- Save files in a local folder

- Navigate to that folder using the command line [I use the Git command line]
- Run: "npm install"
 [Requires NodeJS]
- Then Run: "npm start" [Should start the server on a local port]
- In a web browser, navigate to: localhost:<port number given above>

Please email me if the steps above do not work. Apologies but I have not been able to test from scratch on multiple computers.
